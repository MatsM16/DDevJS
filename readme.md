# DDevJS
This is an asset package developed as needed to suit other projects of mine.
At the moment, this project is **very WIP** and as such, is not recommended for production environments.
**DDevJS** deprecates **DDevLib**, a similar project.




## Install

### Development
Development assets contains inline sourcemaps for easier debugging

1. Download the **dev.ddevjs.zip** from **/build**
2. Extract the assets you want into your project

### Production
Production files do not contain sourcemaps, but offer extra compressed asset variants

1. Download the **ddevjs.zip** file from **/build**
2. Extract the assets you want into your project




## Goal

### Library
- [ ] Web Component library
